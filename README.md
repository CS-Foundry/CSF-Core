### Key Features

- **🚀 Single Binary Deployment:** No complex container orchestration required. One service, everything included.
- **🛡️ Rust-Powered Security:** Memory safety and high performance driven by the Rust core.
- **🎨 Modern UI:** Reactive frontend built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, directly integrated.
- **🔌 Remote Agent:** Standalone binary for decentralized management of remote nodes.
